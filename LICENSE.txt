THIS IS NOT YOUR USUAL OPEN-SOURCE LICENSE, IT IS SHORTER, DESIGNED TO BE EASY FOR YOU TO READ.  PLEASE PLEASE READ IT, SO I
DON'T HAVE TO SEND MY LAWYERS AFTER YOU AND SO I WILL LOVE WORKING WITH YOU!

* You are more than welcome to use this script to facilitate the ecommerce operations of your business.  I do not *require*
  you to give me anything in return for it, but if you use it and find it makes you successful, I'd love you to at least do
  me a solid and drop me a note in IRC (see the README) or possibly even grant me one of my "wishes" from the README file.

* You MAY NOT represent this code, or any part of it, as your own.  I will even give you a quick cheat-sheet for how to
  steal a line of my code as your own...

  TO STEAL A LINE OF MY CODE AS YOUR OWN:
   > All variable names must be changed (except those that are so-called PHP "superglobals" like _POST, _GET, and _REQUEST).
   > All function names must be changed (except those that are standard PHP functions).
   > Any line of code with a parenthesis (that's not part of a string) must have the spacing around the parenthesis changed.
   > Any line of code with a comma (that's not part of a string) must have the spacing around the comma changed.
   > Any curly brace that's part of code structure must be moved around (this usually means move an opening curly brace to
       the next line with my coding style).
   > Any line of code that has an array with square braces must have either the spacing inside the braces or the quote style
       changed.

  That's right, this is partly a learning experience, if you can change around code like that you've learned something.  If
  you learn something from my code, I'll gladly let you piece it apart and toss it all over the place. ;)
